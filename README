IMAGE GENIUS FILE UTIL

=======================================================================================

How to set up:

* pull the code
* open config/config.rb and set your options (input_path is the most likely to need to be changed)
* NOTE: please do not push your changes to config.rb

Running the util:

* cd into the project directory
* run the command "ruby lib/image_genius.rb"
* your output should appear in the correct folder; it may take a while when processing large numbers of image files
